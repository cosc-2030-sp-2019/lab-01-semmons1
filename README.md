Statement of help: <br />
I received a small amount of help from online forums such as "cplusplus.com" whenever I had a question about a specific function, such as the subtract whitespace function. <br />
I also used the textbook for this class, and an academic article written by the University of Alberta for BMP file information. <br /> 

As noted in the lab, "...This is a very simple form of RLE encoding. It saves a ton of space by condensing specific formats and patterns. One thing to note is that it would appear the whitespace elimination process chops off
any "0" that may appear at the end of these formats. I could not find a way to improve this flagging process, and while it's not a huge deal, it's an important note to make."<br /> 
This issue has been fixed
